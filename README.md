# Enrichment Analyses
March 1, 2023 

## Setup

Today we're going to be primarily using R. If you don't have R/RStudio installed, you can refer to our guide [here](https://github.com/HMS-Data-Club/Resources/blob/main/Guides/install-r-rstudio.md).

We will be using the [EnrichmentBrowser](http://bioconductor.org/packages/EnrichmentBrowser) package for our analyses in R.
